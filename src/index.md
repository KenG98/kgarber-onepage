## Projects

### This website

This static website was generated using node.js, eleventy, markdown, and sakura.css,
and is hosted on GitHub pages.

### gopro-chapter-merge

Long GoPro recordings are split into smaller video files (chapters) to protect from file corruption.
I used Python and FFmpeg to create a command line tool that merges chapter files.

### better-html

BetterHTML used YAML to make responsive website generation easy.

### WhenIsTheBus

My university shuttle had an iOS bus-tracking app.
I reverse engineered the public API to create a cross-platform mobile website.

It gained some traction. Here's an article about the project.
