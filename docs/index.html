<h2>Projects</h2>

and is hosted on GitHub pages.

<h3>gopro-chapter-merge</h3>
<p>Long GoPro recordings are split into smaller video files (chapters) to protect from file corruption.
I used Python and FFmpeg to create a command line tool that merges chapter files.

<h3>WhenIsTheBus</h3>
<p>My university shuttle had an iOS bus-tracking app.
I reverse engineered the public API to create a cross-platform mobile website.

<p>It gained some traction. Here's an article about the project.
